alignment (left, center, right, or top, center). Text boxes can also be resized
by clicking and dragging from the bottom right corner.

# Console
The console will be used for creating data structures with specific attributes
that are simpler to specify by typing than by many individual clicks. Currently
it can be used to change the drawing mode by typing "mode X", where X is the new
drawing mode.

The console can be dragged by clicking anywhere above the input area and
can be resized by clicking and dragging the bottom right corner.
